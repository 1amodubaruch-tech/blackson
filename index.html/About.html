  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    My name is MICHAEL, and I bring a unique blend of skills to the world of technology. 
    With a university background in <strong>Banking and Finance</strong>, I understand the 
    importance of precision, security, and efficiency — qualities that are essential in 
    both financial systems and modern web applications. This foundation allows me to 
    approach coding not just as a technical exercise, but as a way to build solutions 
    that are reliable, scalable, and business‑oriented.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond finance, I have hands‑on experience as a <strong>Phone Engineer</strong>. 
    Working with hardware taught me the value of troubleshooting, attention to detail, 
    and designing systems that integrate seamlessly with user needs. These same principles 
    guide my web development process: I treat every project as a system that must be 
    optimized, debugged, and fine‑tuned for performance.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a <strong>Web Developer</strong>, I merge these experiences into code. I build 
    frontends that are intuitive and engaging, backends that are secure and efficient, 
    and full‑stack solutions that reflect both technical excellence and business insight. 
    Whether I’m designing a financial dashboard, engineering a mobile‑friendly interface, 
    or integrating APIs, my goal is always the same: to create technology that solves 
    real problems and empowers people.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don’t just write code — I translate ideas into digital reality. My journey through 
    finance, engineering, and development has given me a perspective that’s both 
    analytical and creative. If you’re looking for someone who can combine technical 
    skill with business understanding, and who thrives on building solutions that matter, 
    then I’m the developer you want to work with.
